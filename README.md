# myFlix-client

The myFlix-client frontend application project is what clients/users will see and interact with when using the myFlix application. The application displays information about movies and a whole lot more. Users are able to register and store user data about movie information like their favorites, etc.

Movie data comes from a REST API and database created in another project (movie_api)

The goal behind this project (Achievement 3) was to create a functioning frontend to go along with the API and database I created previously (Achievement 2). This project will complete the myFlix app and provide a fully functioning app for users to enjoy.

At this point (12/04/23), to visit the functioning site, visit: http://localhost:1234 where a colored display message of "Good morning" will appear on an otherwise blank screen.
